            "By making web pages close or distant (e.g. page ranking), the search ingines control Internet architecture"

            "In the early days of Internet, the slope was slight, allowing for digital wandering and serendipity. Today, however, the slope is much steeper and we slide almost systematically toward the same servies."

        <p>In this reading, the authors' primary objective was to explore social, political, and economic issues on the internet through 15 conceptual spatialization exercises.
            <br><br>
            The term "synchorsation," which I still struggle to pronounce correctly, refers to shared spaces such as schools, libraries, and public parks. The internet is conceptualized as a global space for synchorisation, presenting a vivid and imaginative view of the internet. However, it's important to recognize that a significant percentage of people are excluded from this "global" space due to factors like economic class, location, or literacy. This seems to be easy to forget.

            Two of the most impactful ideas discussed in this reading were Google's dominant position in shaping the "architecture" of the internet and the shift in the internet experience from one of user choice and exploration to a pre-defined path designed for maximum attention and profit.
            <br><br>
            I found myself growing frustrated when I realized how concentrated the power to define the very essence of the internet has become. Google is not God. How can something be considered a shared space when it's essentially constructed by a for-profit corporation?
            <br><br>
            The internet experience has become less unique. I increasingly find myself viewing the same TikToks as my friends. I recall a specific instance when my cousin and I were sitting at the dining table, and our phones played the exact same TikTok video simultaneously. As user interfaces become more simplified and less focused on choice while prioritizing entertainment, we lose the distinct experience of exploring the web. In my opinion, this sucks.
            <br><br>
            
            I also would like to note how the use of mediphor and vidualiziton was very inspiring to me in this reading.
